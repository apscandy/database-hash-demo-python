## **Why**

The question everyone will ask at some point, salt and pepper is indented to address the short comings of storing hashed passwords in a database. Ok so what are the aforementioned short comings, lets say two uses have the same passwords and we are using authentication model without salt or pepper in place, in the event a hacker gets access to the database the hacker can see who has the same password making it more effective for a hacker to crack one hash and get access to anyone with the same password.
